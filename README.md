# Faceshapedetection
The shape detection process in the code analyzes the facial shape by detecting landmarks, measuring key distances and angles, and classifying the face into a specific shape based on these measurements. The approach is robust for analyzing the face in a single, non-moving image, providing insights into the geometric characteristics of the face.
